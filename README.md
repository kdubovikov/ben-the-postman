This is a simple example of how LSTM neural networks can be used to generate text based on a large corpus. You can read more about LSTMs and test generation [here](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

I have used Thunderbird to export all of my emails using [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools/) and then removed all uninformative data like my signature and SMTP headers. After the corpus was fed to the Keras-based LSTM network.
